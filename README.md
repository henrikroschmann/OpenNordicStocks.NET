OpenNordicStocks.NET is an open-source .NET service and SDK providing daily and historical stock data for Sweden, Denmark, and Finland (NASDAQ Nordic OMX). Free, cacheable, and CDN-ready ‚Äî designed for developers and analysts who need reliable Nordic market data.

## üì¶ Projects

This solution consists of four main projects:

### OpenNordicStocks.Core
Core library containing models and provider interfaces for Nordic stock data.

**Features:**
- `StockData` - Model representing individual stock information
- `StockSnapshot` - Model representing a complete market snapshot
- `IStockDataProvider` - Interface for implementing data providers

### OpenNordicStocks.Client
NuGet SDK for consuming stock data from the OpenNordicStocks CDN.

**Installation:**
```bash
dotnet add package OpenNordicStocks.Client
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
using OpenNordicStocks.Client;

var client = new OpenNordicStocksClient();

// Get latest stock data
var latestSnapshot = await client.GetLatestSnapshotAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Total stocks: {latestSnapshot.Stocks.Count}");

// Get data for a specific date
var historicalSnapshot = await client.GetSnapshotForDateAsync(new DateTime(2025, 10, 28));
```

### OpenNordicStocks.Publisher
Console application that fetches stock data and publishes normalized JSON snapshots.

**Usage:**
```bash
export DATA_DIRECTORY=./data
dotnet run --project src/OpenNordicStocks.Publisher/OpenNordicStocks.Publisher.csproj

This project is designed to run as a GitHub Action on a daily schedule, automatically fetching and publishing stock data.
